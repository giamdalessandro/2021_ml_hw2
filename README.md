# HW2: Image Classification with small data

In this homework, you are invited to train image classifiers for a small data set.

## Dataset

Dataset and instructions are provided in the attached slides.
- dataset: 
	- CIFAR10: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YxEsY80kaivAUWR3FTcOW4kwK7mrffKb
	- Argos: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bxxqx_AAp2u2Zkp4cGxoNVEzb3M?resourcekey=0-RKOYOxuHZTxh0eSZRSnIoA
- code: https://github.com/lorenzobrigato/sapienza_ml21_deic

You have to define two new solutions (i.e., two training models), compare them and submit the best one. You have to describe in the report the developed models, details on training and validation, and the comparative results.


## Submission

The output of the assignment should be:
1) A report (PDF file of about 10 pages, with your name and matricola code) describing the implemented solution: how data have been preprocessed, which method/algorithm has been used, which configurations of the method have been tried, description of the evaluation method used, and obtained results using appropriate metrics. Conclusions should discuss the comparative results. Computational training time can also be interesting to report and comment.
2) A ZIP file with the code you used in the project (see slides for details)
3) your best trained model (see slides for details)

Submit the three files in this assignment (other submission methods, such as e-mail, will not be accepted). Make sure to turn the assignment in, otherwise it will not reach the teachers. 
NOTE: do not put the PDF report into the ZIP file!!! ZIP file and model file must be named with your matricola code (see slides)

This assignment must be individual (i.e., one submission for each student) and original (i.e., not equal or too similar to other works either from other students in this class or from other sources). Evaluation will be based on the appropriateness and correctness of the described solution, regardless of the numeric results (as long as they are reasonable). The results on the blind test also do not affect the evaluation of this homework.
